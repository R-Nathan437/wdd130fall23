    <p>
        Hey, my name is Nathan and I'm studying computer science. I'm from Firestone, Colorado; a similar climate to Rexburg.
        I spent the winter learning how to snowboard. I enjoy being active, specifcially playing sports such as volleyball or pickleball.
        I am not married, but I do have a beautiful gilfriend who I've been dating or just under a year.
        My major is computer science, and I'm excited to learn more about the design aspects.
        I have been a member of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints since I was born, so in all, 21 years.
        I look forward to learning what this class has to offer.
    </p>
